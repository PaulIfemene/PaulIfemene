        <h4>IT Student</h4>
        <p>Hello! I'm Paul, an international student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. My passion lies in technology and its potential to improve lives. I enjoy working with Python programming, UI/UX design, robotics, and web and application development.

        Currently, I serve as the Vice President of the International Students Association at my university, where I strive to create a supportive community for fellow students. I'm also excited about my project, Quicktask, which aims to help students find small gigs while studying.
        
        In my spare time, I enjoy exploring philosophy, playing chess, and working on creative projects like a sticker business called "Colors." I'm also dedicated to improving AI systems to speak Igbo with the Igbo accent, and I'm currently learning Luganda to connect with more cultures.
        
        I believe in continuous learning and am always open to new experiences and challenges. Feel free to connect with me!

        <p>Hello! I'm Paul, an international student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. My passion lies in technology and its potential to improve lives. I enjoy working with Python programming, UI/UX design, robotics, and web and application development.

        Currently, I serve as the Vice President of the International Students Association at my university, where I strive to create a supportive community for fellow students. I'm also excited about my project, Quicktask, which aims to help students find small gigs while studying.
        
        In my spare time, I enjoy exploring philosophy, playing chess, and working on creative projects like a sticker business called "Colors." I'm also dedicated to improving AI systems to speak Igbo with the Igbo accent, and I'm currently learning Luganda to connect with more cultures.
        
        I believe in continuous learning and am always open to new experiences and challenges. Feel free to connect with me!

        <p>Hello! I'm Paul, an international student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. My passion lies in technology and its potential to improve lives. I enjoy working with Python programming, UI/UX design, robotics, and web and application development.

        Currently, I serve as the Vice President of the International Students Association at my university, where I strive to create a supportive community for fellow students. I'm also excited about my project, Quicktask, which aims to help students find small gigs while studying.
        
        In my spare time, I enjoy exploring philosophy, playing chess, and working on creative projects like a sticker business called "Colors." I'm also dedicated to improving AI systems to speak Igbo with the Igbo accent, and I'm currently learning Luganda to connect with more cultures.
        
        I believe in continuous learning and am always open to new experiences and challenges. Feel free to connect with me!
